## Color Generator Module
This module is a custom HTML element that changes color when clicked. It generates a unique random color and fills the element with that color.

## Usage
To use this module, simply include the color-change tag in your HTML:
<color-change></color-change>

## Events
CLICK: When you click anywhere on the color-change element, it will start to fill with a unique random color. The color will spread from the point where you clicked to the edges of the element. Once the element is completely filled, you can click again to start a new color fill.

### Features
Random color generation: The module generates a unique random color for each fill. The color is displayed in the format '#RRGGBB'.

Dynamic fill: The color fill starts from the point where you clicked and spreads to the edges of the element. The fill process is animated, so you can watch the color spread.

Custom element: The module is implemented as a custom HTML element, so you can use it just like any other HTML tag.
